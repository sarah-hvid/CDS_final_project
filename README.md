# Introduction to Cultural Data Science - Final project
This repository contains all data and scripts used in my final project. 

- The scripts folder contains all code from both Python, OpenRefine and RStudio. 
- The csv folder contains the csv files generated through the code. 
- The data folder contains the raw data in XML version and the preprocessed text data. 

To rerun code, create an empty folder called 'ibsen_network'. Place the scripts and data folder within this folder. Then, place the csv folder within the data folder. The directory setup should now be the same as when the code was created.
